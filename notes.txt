Using the "shunting yard" algorithm when parsing an expression.

Need to create unit tests and a test framework.

Fix bug in file_io.c where files appear to be closed before we are actualy 
finished with them.

Resolve the design issue with symbol attributes being saved. Do I keep them in 
an array or a hash? Do I need to store more than one of the same type?
